/** 
 * Medium -Eric Elliott
 * 
 * Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy,
 * in event handlers and callback functions, and in partial applications,
 * currying, and other functional programming patterns.
 * 
 * A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope
 *  from an inner function. 
 * In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created,
 *  at function creation time.
 * 
 * To use a closure, define a function inside another function and expose it.
 *  To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.
 * 
 * More example cf.js line no. 128

// privileged methods. 
// In JavaScript, any exposed method defined within the closure scope is privileged.
